# Rich Markdown

A plugin that will finally allow you to ditch the markdown viewer, saving space and making your life easier.

Rich Markdown comes as a collection of multiple features that can be toggled in settings.

# Features

## Images in Editor
Any image that is contained on it's own line of the markdown source will render directly on the line directly below. This works for both internal resources and generic links to images

## Checkbox
Checkboxes can be toggled in the markdown source by Ctrl+Clicking between the square brackets.

## Links
Links to other notes can be followed by Ctrl+Clicking on the resource ID of the link.
